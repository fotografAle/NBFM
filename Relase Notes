My most important changes to the old pifm code are:
- ppM frequency correction, deviation, pre-emphasys, output power settings by command-line parameters
- frequency synthesis using not only the fractional PLL but also the "DMA modulation",
- switch output off when exiting,
- sinewave tone for ctcss applications etc.
- correct correlation between deviation, center frequency and sampling rate
- other minor changes...
